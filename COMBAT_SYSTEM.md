# Combat System Documentation

## Overview

A turn-based combat system where characters fight each other using their stats and equipped items. Combat is calculated based on character attributes (strength, vitality, dexterity) and equipment bonuses.

## Version 1.0 Features

### âœ… What's Implemented

#### 1. **Stat Calculation System**

- Characters have base stats: `strength`, `vitality`, `dexterity`
- Equipment provides bonus stats through affixes
- Calculated stats include:
  - **HP (Health Points)**: `100 + (vitality Ã— 10) + bonusHP`
  - **Damage**: `(strength Ã— 2) + dexterity + weaponDamage + bonusDamage`
  - **Defense**: `(vitality Ã— 0.5) + bonusDefense`

#### 2. **Combat Mechanics**

- Turn-based combat with alternating attacks
- Damage calculation includes:
  - Base damage from attacker
  - Defense reduction: `damage - (defense Ã— 0.5)`
  - Random variance: Â±10% for unpredictability
  - Minimum damage: always at least 1
- Combat continues until one character reaches 0 HP

#### 3. **Equipment Integration**

- Weapon damage from `main_hand` slot
- All equipment affixes are counted (damage, defense, hp, strength, vitality, dexterity)
- Affixes supported:
  - `strength`, `vitality`, `dexterity` (stat bonuses)
  - `damage`, `defense`, `hp` (direct combat bonuses)

#### 4. **Reward System**

- Winner receives:
  - **Experience**: `opponentLevel Ã— 50`
  - **Gold**: `opponentLevel Ã— 10`
- Rewards automatically added to character

## Database Considerations

### Current Schema - No Changes Needed âœ…

The existing database schema supports combat without modifications:

- Characters have all necessary base stats
- Equipment system is fully functional
- Affixes provide combat bonuses

### Optional Future Tables

If adding persistence features:

```sql
-- Track active combats
CREATE TABLE active_combats (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  character1_id INT,
  character2_id INT,
  combat_state JSON,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (character1_id) REFERENCES characters(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (character2_id) REFERENCES characters(id)
);

-- Combat history
CREATE TABLE combat_history (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  winner_id INT,
  loser_id INT,
  turns INT,
  experience_gained INT,
  gold_gained INT,
  combat_log TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (winner_id) REFERENCES characters(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (loser_id) REFERENCES characters(id)
);
```

---

## Testing the Combat System

### Prerequisites

1. Create at least 2 characters
2. Equip some items with damage/defense affixes
3. Have some base stats (strength, vitality, dexterity)

### Test Sequence

1. **Check your character stats**

   ```
   GET /character/stats
   ```

2. **Find an opponent**

   ```
   GET /character/all
   ```

3. **Fight an opponent**

   ```
   POST /combat/fight
   { "opponentCharacterId": 2 }
   ```

### Expected Behavior

- Characters with higher stats should win more often
- Better equipment should give significant advantage
- Combat should be deterministic (same stats = predictable outcome, with slight variance)
- Winner always receives exp and gold
- Minimum 1 damage per hit

---

## Formula Reference

```javascript
// Max HP
maxHP = 100 + (vitality Ã— 10) + bonusHP

// Damage Output
damage = (strength Ã— 2) + dexterity + weaponDamage + bonusDamage

// Defense
defense = (vitality Ã— 0.5) + bonusDefense

// Actual Damage Dealt
actualDamage = attackerDamage - (defenderDefense Ã— 0.5)
finalDamage = actualDamage Ã— randomFactor(0.9 to 1.1)
finalDamage = max(1, finalDamage) // Minimum 1

// Rewards (for winner only)
experienceGained = opponentLevel Ã— 50
goldGained = opponentLevel Ã— 10
```
